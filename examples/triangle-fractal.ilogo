TO TRIANGLE.FRACTAL :LENGTH :DEPTH

  ; base case:
  ; just move forward, no more squares
  IF :DEPTH = 0 [
    FORWARD :LENGTH
    STOP ()
  ]

  ; recursive case:
  ; draw a triangle such that each side of
  ; the triangle has TRIANGLE.FRACTAL in it.
  REPEAT 3 [
      FORWARD :LENGTH / 3
      TRIANGLE.FRACTAL (:LENGTH / 3 :DEPTH - 1)
      FORWARD :LENGTH / 3
